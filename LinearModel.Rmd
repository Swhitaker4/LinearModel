## Introduction

Form three regression models; Model1 is SIMS~ARM, Model2 is SIMS~GRIP, and Model3 is SIMS~ARM+GRIP. For each model find a 95% prediction interval of SIMS given a value of 94  for GRIP and 88 for ARM. Compare Model1 with Model3 using anova. Write it up in a markdown document, push the project up to your github account and submit it back to canvas as link. 

## SIMS~ARM 

```{r}
plot(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```

This scatter plot shows that the greater the the pounds of arm force(ARM), the greater simulation(SIMS)


```{r}
cor(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```

This number represents the correlation between sims and arm force.Correlation is a measure of the linear association between the two variables. 

```{r}
model.1 <- lm(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
summary.lm(model.1)
```
The equation is SIMS = -.4.095160 + 0.054563 * ARM

```{r}
newData= data.frame(GRIP=94,ARM=88)
predict.lm(model.1,newData,interval="prediction")
```


##SIMS~GRIP
```{r}
plot(SIMS~GRIP,data=data)
```

This is a generic scatters plot of SIMS vs ARM
```{r}
cor(SIMS~GRIP,data=data)
```


## SIMS~ARM+GRIP

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
