## Introduction

Form three regression models; Model1 is SIMS~ARM, Model2 is SIMS~GRIP, and Model3 is SIMS~ARM+GRIP. For each model find a 95% prediction interval of SIMS given a value of 94  for GRIP and 88 for ARM. Compare Model1 with Model3 using anova. Write it up in a markdown document, push the project up to your github account and submit it back to canvas as link. 

## SIMS~ARM 

```{r}
plot(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```

This scatter plot shows that the greater the the pounds of arm force(ARM), the greater simulation(SIMS)


```{r}
cor(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```

This number represents the correlation between sims and arm force.Correlation is a measure of the linear association between the two variables. 

```{r}
model.1 <- lm(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
summary.lm(model.1)
```
The equation is SIMS = -.4.095160 + 0.054563 * ARM

```{r}
newData= data.frame(GRIP=94,ARM=88)
predict.lm(model.1,newData,interval="prediction")
```



##SIMS~GRIP
```{r}
plot(SIMS~GRIP,data=data)
```

This is a generic scatters plot of SIMS vs ARM
```{r}
cor(SIMS~GRIP,data=data)
```
the greater the pounds of the GRIP force(GRIP), the greater the simulation(SIMS)
```{r}
model.2 <-lm(SIMS~GRIP,data=data)
summary.lm(model.2)
```
The equation is -4.089675 + 0.045463 *GRIP
```{r}
basicNN <-ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=GRIP))
```

```{r}
basicNN + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
```

This scatter plot shows the blue line as an indicator of which is a best linear fit t predict what an average sim response would be for any grip strength.

It also shows all of the data points of each individual score and corresponding grip strength.

model(SIMS~ARM) has slighty lighter Residual standard error score of 1.226 while model2(SIMS~GRIP) is scored at 1.295

model1(SIMS~ARM) has a higher adjusted r squared score of 0.467 while model2(SIMS~GRIP)scored lower at 0.4053

models appears to be the better model because it has a lower Residual standard error score than model1 and also has a higher adjusted r square score than model2

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
